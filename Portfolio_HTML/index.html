        <p>
           I am a dedicated and curious learner with a passion for web development, programming, and technology.
            Currently pursuing my studies in Computer Science, I enjoy creating user-friendly websites, exploring data, and solving real-world problems through code. 
            I thrive in collaborative environments and am always eager to learn new tools and frameworks.
            My goal is to contribute to meaningful projects and continuously grow as a developer. 
            With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript, I aim to build innovative digital solutions that make a positive impact.
